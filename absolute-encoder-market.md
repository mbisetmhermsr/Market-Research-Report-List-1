<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shafted</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absolute encoders are used in various industries to provide accurate position feedback. They are available in different types, such as shafted and hollow shaft encoders. Shafted encoders have a solid shaft that rotates along with the machinery they are mounted on, while hollow shaft encoders have a hollow design that allows them to be mounted directly on the shaft of the machinery. Both types provide absolute position values without the need for homing or recalibration, making them ideal for applications requiring precise positioning and control.</p></p>
