<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Ribbon Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat ribbon cables come in two main types: shielded and unshielded. Shielded cables have an additional layer of shielding material, such as aluminum foil or copper braid, to protect against electromagnetic interference. This makes them ideal for use in environments with high levels of interference, such as industrial settings. On the other hand, unshielded cables do not have this extra protection, making them more cost-effective and easier to work with in simpler applications. Both types have their own strengths and are chosen based on the specific needs of the application.</p></p>
