<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-Agglomerate (AA) Inhibitors</li><li>Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs) are chemical substances used in the oil and gas industry to prevent the formation of gas hydrates, which can block pipelines and equipment. There are two main types of LDHIs: Anti-Agglomerate (AA) Inhibitors, which prevent hydrate particles from sticking together and forming larger clumps, and Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHI), which slow down the rate of hydrate formation. Both types of LDHIs are essential for maintaining the flow of gas and oil in subsea pipelines and production facilities.</p></p>
