<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Steel Sheets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oriented Electrical Steel</li><li>Non-oriented Electrical Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrical steel sheets are classified into two main types: oriented electrical steel and non-oriented electrical steel. Oriented electrical steel is designed to have magnetic properties that are highly directional, providing increased efficiency in electrical equipment such as transformers. Non-oriented electrical steel, on the other hand, has magnetic properties that are more uniform and isotropic, making it suitable for applications where the magnetic field is not directional. These two types of electrical steel cater to different needs in the electrical industry, serving specific purposes based on their unique magnetic properties.</p></p>
