<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resin Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching</li><li>Selective-etching</li><li>Total-etching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite resin bonding agents are used in dentistry for adhering composite fillings to teeth. They can be categorized into three types based on the etching process: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching. </p><p>Self-etching bonding agents eliminate the need for separate etching as they simultaneously etch and bond. Selective-etching bonding agents involve etching the enamel while preserving the dentin. Total-etching bonding agents etch both enamel and dentin separately for optimal bonding strength. Each type has its own advantages and is selected based on the specific clinical requirements.</p></p>
