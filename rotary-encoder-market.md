<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Rotary Encoders</li><li>Absolute Rotary Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary encoders are devices used to measure the angular position of a rotating shaft. There are two main types of rotary encoders: incremental and absolute. Incremental rotary encoders produce a series of pulses as the shaft rotates, allowing for relative position measurement. Absolute rotary encoders provide an absolute position value for the shaft, eliminating the need for a reference point. Both types of rotary encoders are widely used in various industries such as manufacturing, robotics, and automotive for precise motion control and feedback purposes.</p></p>
