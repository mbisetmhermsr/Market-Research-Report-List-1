<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Industry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide industry is mainly divided into two market types: anticoagulants rodenticides and non-anticoagulants rodenticides. Anticoagulants rodenticides work by preventing blood clotting in rodents, leading to internal bleeding and eventual death. Non-anticoagulants rodenticides, on the other hand, target different biological systems in rodents to effectively eliminate them. Both types of rodenticides are widely used in pest control and agriculture to manage rodent infestations and protect crops from damage.</p></p>
