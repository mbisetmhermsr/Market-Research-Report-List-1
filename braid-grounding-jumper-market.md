<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braid Grounding Jumper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-insulated</li><li>Insulated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Braid grounding jumpers come in two main market types: non-insulated and insulated. Non-insulated jumpers are made of bare metal braids that provide a direct electrical connection between two points, such as metal equipment or structures. Insulated jumpers, on the other hand, are covered in a protective layer of insulation to prevent accidental contact with live electrical components. Both types of grounding jumpers serve the purpose of safely diverting excess electrical current to the ground to prevent electrical hazards.</p></p>
