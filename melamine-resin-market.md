<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melamine Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Methylated Melamine Resin</li><li>Non-methylated Melamine Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Melamine resin is a type of thermosetting plastic that is commonly used in a variety of applications. There are two main types of melamine resin: methylated and non-methylated. Methylated melamine resin is treated with formaldehyde to improve its chemical and heat resistance properties, making it more durable and suitable for high-performance applications. Non-methylated melamine resin, on the other hand, does not undergo this treatment and is typically used in lower-end products where cost is a consideration. Both types of melamine resin offer unique benefits depending on the intended application.</p></p>
