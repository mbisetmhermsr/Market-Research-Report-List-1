<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clad Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Clad steel plates are created through two main processes: explosion bonded and roll bonded. In explosion bonded clad steel plates, a layer of metal is bonded to a base metal through a high-energy explosive reaction. This results in a strong bond between the two materials. On the other hand, roll bonded clad steel plates involve the layering of two metals under high pressure and temperature. This process creates a metallurgical bond between the metals, ensuring durability and strength in the resulting clad steel plate.</p></p>
