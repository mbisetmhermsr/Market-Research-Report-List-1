<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defense & Security Side Scan Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Multi-beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defense and Security Side Scan Sonar market consists of two main types: Single-beam and Multi-beam systems. Single-beam sonars emit a single acoustic beam that scans the seafloor in a narrow path, providing a detailed but limited view of the area. On the other hand, Multi-beam sonars use multiple beams to cover a wider area and provide a more comprehensive image of the seafloor. Single-beam sonars are typically used for shallow-water applications, while Multi-beam sonars are ideal for deep-sea surveys and mapping.</p></p>
