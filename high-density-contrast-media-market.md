<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Density Contrast Media Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Iodine Based</li><li>Barium Sulfate Compounds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Density Contrast Media Market includes two main types - Iodine Based and Barium Sulfate Compounds. Iodine Based contrast media are commonly used for procedures like CT scans and angiograms due to their high absorption of X-rays. Barium Sulfate Compounds, on the other hand, are used for imaging the gastrointestinal tract as they are not absorbed by the body and provide excellent visualization of the digestive system. Both types play a crucial role in diagnostic imaging and are chosen based on the specific medical procedure.</p></p>
