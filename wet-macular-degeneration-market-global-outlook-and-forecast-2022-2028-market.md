<p><p>Wet macular degeneration is a chronic eye condition that leads to the deterioration of the macula, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp and detailed vision. This condition can cause severe vision loss or blindness if left untreated. The global wet macular degeneration market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2028.</p><p>The increasing prevalence of wet macular degeneration, particularly among the aging population, is a major factor driving the market growth. According to the National Eye Institute, around 11 million people in the United States have some form of age-related macular degeneration, and the number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. Moreover, the rising awareness about the availability of advanced treatment options and the increasing demand for early diagnosis and treatment are fueling market growth.</p><p>In terms of treatment, the market is witnessing a shift towards the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, which are highly effective in reducing the progression of wet macular degeneration. These drugs inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina and help improve vision in patients. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on combination therapies, such as incorporating photodynamic therapy or laser treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, to enhance the treatment outcomes.</p><p>Regionally, North America dominates the wet macular degeneration market due to the high prevalence of the condition and the availability of advanced healthcare infrastructure. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period, driven by the increasing geriatric population and rising healthcare expenditure in countries like China and India.</p><p>Overall, the global wet macular degeneration market is anticipated to experience substantial growth in the coming years, thanks to factors such as a growing aging population, increasing awareness, and advancements in treatment options.</p></p>
