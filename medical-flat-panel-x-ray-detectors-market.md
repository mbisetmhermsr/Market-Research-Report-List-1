<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical flat panel X-ray detectors are essential tools used in medical imaging equipment to produce high-quality images for diagnosis. There are two main types of detectors: indirect conversion and direct conversion. </p><p>Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillator material to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then converted into an electrical signal for image capture. On the other hand, direct conversion detectors use semiconductor materials to directly convert X-rays into electrical signals without the need for a scintillator. Both types have their advantages and are used in various medical imaging applications.</p></p>
