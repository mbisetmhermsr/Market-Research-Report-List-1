<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lead Acid (SLA) Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AGM Battery</li><li>GEL Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lead Acid (SLA) Battery Market consists of two main types: AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) Battery and GEL Battery. AGM batteries use a fiberglass mat to absorb and immobilize the electrolyte, providing a maintenance-free and leak-proof solution. GEL batteries use a silica additive to turn the electrolyte into a thick gel-like substance, reducing the risk of spillage and allowing for better performance in deep cycle applications. Both types are popular choices for a variety of applications due to their reliability, durability, and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
