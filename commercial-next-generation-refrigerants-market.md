<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Next Generation Refrigerants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Refrigerants</li><li>Hydrofluoroolefins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial next generation refrigerants market is categorized into two main types: natural refrigerants and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). Natural refrigerants are substances found in nature, such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons, that have low or zero ozone depletion and global warming potential. On the other hand, HFOs are man-made chemicals designed to have lower environmental impact compared to traditional fluorocarbon refrigerants. Both types aim to provide more sustainable alternatives to conventional refrigerants in order to reduce their environmental impact.</p></p>
